 * The "Was this page helpful?" rating (`PageFeedback.astro`). A rating is
 * sent as a `feedback` analytics event, the buttons give way to a thank-you,
 * and, with `feedback.comments` on, a box below asks the reader to say more.
 * A comment they send goes out as a `feedback_comment` event with the same
 * rating, path, and title, so the two line up in a dashboard.
 *
 * Both go through analytics, so under a consent layer (`consent`) the widget
 * renders hidden and only shows once the reader allows analytics: from
 * anyone else, an answer would go nowhere.
 *
 * Runs on the initial load and again after every client-router swap, which
 * rebuilds the widget from server-rendered markup, so the handlers always
 * bind to the freshly swapped-in elements.
